# Functional Utilities

### Ideas:

- Functional Comparer (in progress)
- Functional Mapper (not started)
- Functional Transducer (not started)

### Priorities

(In order of importance)

1. performance
2. type support
3. api "ergonomics"
4. simplicity in implementation

### Inspiration

Inspiration of the api design comes heavily from RxJS and NgRx. These libraries
demonstrate the kind of functional interface and type support that I'm aiming for.

### Playground

When something gets on npm [this](https://stackblitz.com/edit/functional-utilities?file=index.ts) will be the playground for testing and getting feedback.
